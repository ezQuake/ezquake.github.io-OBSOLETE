- Support for MVDSV protocol extension to help with movement through teleports on high ping (`/cl_pext_lagteleport 1` to enable)

### Demo playback
- Various bugs fixed with `/cl_multiview`, particularly when using `/cl_mvinset 1`
- Matchless .mvd files should now play back correctly

- Connecting to server with protocol extensions doesn't break subsequent .dem playback

- `/demo_capture_background_threads` allows background writing of screenshots
- Can now playback demo files from within .zip files on linux systems
- Client disconnections in .qwd with no explanation (client kicked in KTPRO?) doesn't end playback

  - New 'compact' mode added (`/scr_compactHud 4`)
- Improved menu scaling on high resolutions

### Renderer
- dynamic lighting performance improved (ported from fodquake)
- Can specify color of projectiles/shaft without creating custom textures (`/gl_custom_*_color`, `/gl_custom_*_fullbright`)
- `/r_shaftalpha` now works when custom lg color set
- `/r_rocketlightcolor` can now have an alpha element specified to control the strength of the effect
- `/cl_gibfilter` will now filter gibbed heads even before the player respawns
- `/gl_outline 2` option for visualising geometry (cheats-enabled only, for map developers)
- `/crosshairscale` allows larger built-in crosshairs to be built (rather than just making small images bigger)
- `/crosshairscalemode` controls crosshair coordinates/sizes for pixel-to-pixel accuracy.
- `/r_skincolormodedead` added, `/r_skincolormode` for corpses (-1 to use same)
- `/r_lerpframes` caused all statics to use frame 0 of the model file (aka: large torches renderered as small on start.bsp)
- `/r_lightdecayrate` controls how fast dynamic lights decay (1 = Quake default, 2 = ezQuake standard)
- Support for translucent players in KTX's multi-race mode
- Support for alpha-tested textures in standard Quake maps, not just halflife BSPs

### Input

- `/gl_gamma 0` is not treated as `/gl_gamma 1` on startup
- `/cfg_load` now respects `/con_bindphysical` setting
